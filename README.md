# CSECourse-Scheduler

A node.js website with a mySQL database that allows for CSE students to search through the CSE course catalog and add courses to their schedule. They can then view their prospective schedule and then return to the catalog to make more additions. Students can search through courses by time, teacher, course name and course number.
